			<p>
				I’m a quick learner who loves solving puzzles and being of service.
				<br>
				<br>
				My foundation in IT began as a Field Technician during the pandemic.  This has been a trying time for our community, and it was a challenge and an honor to serve as an essential worker.
				<br>
				<br>
				I’m proud to continue serving my community in my current position at Contra Costa Health, where I collaborate with several IT departments in providing support to our hospitals and clinics.
				<br>
				<br>
				I’m also attending school full-time on my way to my degree in Computer Science and have a special interest in SQL and Python programming, disaster recovery, and security.
